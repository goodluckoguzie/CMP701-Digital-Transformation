# CMP701 - Lab 05: Questions and Answers for Groups
**Date:** March 06, 2025

## Group 1: Nike — Digital Innovation in Supply Chain and Customer Engagement

1. **Q:** Given Nike’s goal to increase online sales by 20% to $10.8 billion, how would you adjust the timeline or budget if the pilot phase (Q1 2025) shows only a 10% sales increase? What additional technologies might you consider?  
   **A:** Adjust Phase 2 rollout to 12 months (Q2–Q4 2025) to refine AI recommendations. Increase budget by $1M for marketing ($7.2M total). Add AR (augmented reality) for virtual sneaker try-ons, costing $500K, to boost engagement and hit $10.8B.

2. **Q:** The Salesforce CRM requires training 1,000 sales staff over two weeks. If employees report the system still slows them down after training, what steps would you take to ensure the 25% efficiency gain (5 mins to 3.75 mins/order)?  
   **A:** Conduct 1-week retraining ($25K), simplify UI with IT (1 month, $50K), test with 100 staff. Monitor order time weekly to hit 3.75 mins/order. Efficiency achieved by Q2 2025 with $75K extra cost.

3. **Q:** Why were RFID tags chosen over smart shelves for inventory management, despite smart shelves offering real-time visibility without tagging? How would you justify the $2M RFID cost to executives if questioned?  
   **A:** RFID chosen for $2M vs. $5M for 10 warehouses, scalable to 100+ sites, integrates with SAP. Shelves less flexible, higher upkeep. Justification: “$2M saves $3M vs. shelves, tracks 10M items with 99% accuracy, aligns with Nike’s ERP.”

4. **Q:** If the dashboard shows 12.5M visits as targeted, but conversion rate stalls at 3.3% instead of 3.75%, what adjustments to the AI strategy would you recommend, and how would you update the Jira issue?  
   **A:** Tweak AI to prioritize high-demand items (e.g., Air Jordan) over niche products, test for 1 month. Jira: “Insight: Traffic at 12.5M, conversion 3.3%. Refine AI for high-demand focus, retest by April 30, 2025. Assignee: Digital Team.”

5. **Q:** If IoT fails to deliver (e.g., RFID accuracy drops below 99%), how would you adapt the supply chain and customer engagement goals to still meet the $10.8B sales target?  
   **A:** Shift focus to AI-driven sales ($10.8B via app personalization), use manual inventory checks temporarily. Cut delivery target to 4.5 days. Sales hit via engagement; supply chain adjusted with $200K extra labor cost.

## Group 2: Starbucks — Mobile App and Loyalty Program Integration

1. **Q:** Starbucks aims for $3.75B in mobile order revenue in 18 months. If the pilot phase (Q1–Q2 2025) shows only a 15% increase, how would you modify the rollout or budget to catch up? Would you prioritize AI or blockchain?  
   **A:** Extend Phase 2 to 14 months (Q3 2025–Q4 2026), add $500K for app promotions ($4.3M total). Prioritize AI—drives orders directly (38.75% share more critical than 60M members initially).

2. **Q:** HubSpot CRM requires training 50,000 baristas, but some report workflow disruptions after a month. How would you achieve the 15% service time reduction (3 mins to 2.55 mins/order), and what would you add to the Jira request?  
   **A:** Add 2-week advanced training ($75K), integrate CRM with POS faster (1 month, $50K), monitor service time daily to hit 2.55 mins/order. Jira: “Change: Workflow issues persist. Add 2-week training, POS integration by May 31, 2025. Assignee: App Team.”

3. **Q:** Google AI was chosen over Watson for cost and Azure compatibility. If scalability issues arise (e.g., app crashes with 50M users), would you stick with Google AI or switch to Watson? Justify with cost and integration.  
   **A:** Stick with Google AI—$500K/year vs. Watson’s $1M, Azure compatibility key. Fix crashes with $200K server upgrade. Justification: “Google saves $500K, aligns with Azure; $200K fix cheaper than $1M switch.”

4. **Q:** If the dashboard shows 55M loyalty members instead of 60M after 30 days, but mobile order share hits 38.75%, what might this suggest about blockchain? How would you update the Jira insight?  
   **A:** Suggests slow blockchain adoption or trust issues—users may not value points security yet. Jira: “Insight: Loyalty at 55M, orders 38.75%. Investigate blockchain awareness, survey users by April 15, 2025. Assignee: Marketing.”

5. **Q:** If app uptime drops to 98% during rollout, how would you adjust the plan to achieve 60M loyalty members and $3.75B revenue?  
   **A:** Add $300K for Azure backup servers, delay blockchain to Q3 2026, focus on AI for $3.75B. Promote loyalty offline ($100K campaign) to hit 60M. Revenue met via orders; membership via promotion.

## Group 3: Ford — IoT and Predictive Analytics in Manufacturing

1. **Q:** Ford targets a 20% downtime reduction (500 to 400 hours/plant). If the pilot phase (Q1–Q2 2025) reduces it by only 10%, how would you adjust the timeline or $4.9M budget? Would you invest more in IoT or AI?  
   **A:** Extend Phase 2 to 20 months (Q3 2025–Q4 2026), add $1M for more sensors ($5.9M total). Prioritize IoT—25,000 sensors boost detection, AI follows with better data.

2. **Q:** SAP ERP causes 2-day downtime per plant, but employees report ongoing disruptions post-training. How would you ensure the 15% waste reduction ($5M savings), and what changes would you make to Jira?  
   **A:** 1-week retraining ($400K), simplify SAP interface (2 months, $200K), stagger switches (1/month). Monitor waste weekly for $5M savings. Jira: “Change: Disruptions persist. Retrain 10K, simplify UI by June 30, 2025. Assignee: Factory IT.”

3. **Q:** Vibration sensors were chosen over edge devices for cost ($2M vs. $5M). If sensors miss 20% of issues during testing, would you switch to edge devices or enhance sensors? Calculate cost and justify.  
   **A:** Enhance sensors—add $500K for advanced models ($150/unit, 20K = $3M total) vs. $5M edge devices. Justification: “$3M saves $2M vs. edge, improves accuracy to 90% with cloud.”

4. **Q:** If downtime is 450 hours/plant and accuracy is 85% after 3 months (vs. 400 and 90%), what adjustments to predictive analytics would you suggest? How would you reflect this in Jira?  
   **A:** Increase training data with 6 months of sensor logs, tweak model (1 month, $100K). Jira: “Insight: Downtime 450 hrs, accuracy 85%. Enhance AI with more data by May 31, 2025. Assignee: Data Scientist.”

5. **Q:** If Google Cloud delays sensor data processing during rollout, how would you adapt to hit the $42.5M cost savings target, and what contingency technologies might you consider?  
   **A:** Use local servers ($1M) for interim processing, aim for 450 hrs downtime, $45M costs. Switch to AWS if delays persist ($1.5M). Outcome: $42.5M met with $500K extra AI tuning; AWS as contingency.
