# Week 2: Cloud Infrastructure and Services

## Overview

Building on Week 1's foundation of cloud computing platforms, Week 2 explores cloud infrastructure components, service models, and practical implementation strategies. This week focuses on understanding how different cloud services work together to enable digital transformation.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- [ ] Understand Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) models
- [ ] Identify key cloud infrastructure components (compute, storage, networking, security)
- [ ] Compare different cloud service providers (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- [ ] Design basic cloud architectures for common use cases
- [ ] Evaluate cloud service costs and optimization strategies

## Topics Covered

### 1. Cloud Service Models

**IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**
- Virtual machines and compute resources
- Storage and networking infrastructure
- Full control over operating systems and applications
- Examples: AWS EC2, Azure Virtual Machines, Google Compute Engine

**PaaS (Platform as a Service)**
- Development and deployment platforms
- Managed databases and middleware
- Focus on application development, not infrastructure
- Examples: Heroku, Azure App Service, Google App Engine

**SaaS (Software as a Service)**
- Complete software solutions delivered over the internet
- No infrastructure or platform management needed
- Examples: Office 365, Salesforce, Google Workspace

### 2. Cloud Infrastructure Components

- **Compute**: Virtual machines, containers, serverless functions
- **Storage**: Object storage, block storage, file storage
- **Networking**: Virtual networks, load balancers, CDN
- **Security**: Identity management, encryption, compliance
- **Monitoring**: Logging, metrics, alerting

### 3. Cloud Service Providers Comparison

| Feature | AWS | Azure | Google Cloud |
|---------|-----|-------|--------------|
| Market Share | Largest | Enterprise focus | Strong in ML/AI |
| Strengths | Broad services | Microsoft integration | Data analytics |
| Pricing Model | Pay-as-you-go | Flexible plans | Sustained use discounts |

### 4. Cloud Architecture Patterns

- **Multi-tier Architecture**: Web, application, database tiers
- **Microservices**: Breaking applications into smaller services
- **Serverless**: Event-driven, function-based computing
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Combining public and private clouds

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Cloud Service Model Identification
Identify which service model (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) each of the following represents:
- Netflix streaming service
- WordPress hosting on AWS
- MongoDB Atlas database
- GitHub code repository

### Exercise 2: Cost Estimation
Use cloud pricing calculators to estimate monthly costs for:
- A web application with 1000 daily users
- A data analytics pipeline processing 1TB daily
- A development/testing environment
