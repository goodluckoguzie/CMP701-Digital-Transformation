# CMP701 Lab 08: Exploring Digital Business Models - Tate Modern, Netflix, and Airbnb Case Studies

## Introduction to Business and Digital Technology Interface

Digital technologies transform how organizations operate by reshaping structures, streamlining processes, and redefining workforce roles. This section explores how digital tools impact organizational structures, processes, and people, with examples of successful integration.

- **Impact on Organizational Structures**: Digital technologies often lead to flatter, more collaborative structures. For example, organizations integrate digital teams across departments, creating roles like digital strategists to support online initiatives.
- **Role in Business Processes**: Digital tools streamline operations, such as automating ticketing or using analytics to optimize supply chains, reducing costs and improving efficiency.
- **Influence on Workforce**: Digital transformation requires new skills, like data analytics or digital content creation, prompting training and hiring of tech-savvy staff.

**Real-Life Examples**:
1. **Amazon**: Uses AI and automation for logistics (e.g., warehouse robots) and customer service (e.g., recommendation algorithms), reducing costs and improving efficiency.
2. **Walmart**: Implements IoT and data analytics for inventory management, optimizing stock levels and supply chain operations.
3. **Netflix**: Leverages streaming technology and data analytics to deliver personalized content, disrupting traditional media by replacing physical DVD rentals with an online platform.

## Case Study Analysis: Tate Modern, Netflix, and Airbnb

This section analyzes three organizations leveraging digital technologies to enhance operations and management practices.

1. **Tate Modern**: A UK-based art gallery, Tate created a “fifth gallery” online through websites, virtual tours, and interactive platforms like Tate Kids. This expanded its global reach, enhanced visitor engagement, and introduced new revenue streams via digital memberships and events.
2. **Netflix**: Transitioned from a DVD rental service to a global streaming platform using cloud-based streaming and AI-driven content recommendations. This disrupted the media industry, optimized content delivery, and created data-driven production processes.
3. **Airbnb**: Transformed the hospitality industry with a digital platform connecting hosts and guests. Using data analytics for pricing and user reviews, Airbnb streamlined booking processes and scaled globally without owning properties.

The following exercises focus on **Tate Modern** to align with the lab’s structure, applying the concepts to its digital transformation.

### 1. Organizational Structure Mapping

**Objective**: Visualize how digital transformation altered Tate’s organizational structure.

**Activity**:
- **Traditional Structure (Pre-Digital)**: Tate’s pre-digital structure was hierarchical, with departments like curatorial, marketing, and operations working independently. The focus was on physical exhibitions, with limited cross-departmental collaboration.
- **Post-Digital Structure**: Digital transformation introduced new roles (e.g., Chief Digital Officer, digital curators) and integrated digital teams across departments. Marketing now collaborates with IT for online campaigns, and curatorial teams work with digital specialists for virtual exhibits.

**Organizational Charts**:

**Pre-Digital Transformation**:
- Director
  - Curatorial Department
  - Marketing Department
  - Operations Department
  - Education Department

**Post-Digital Transformation**:
- Director
  - Chief Digital Officer
    - Digital Content Team
    - Web Development Team
  - Curatorial Department (with digital curators)
  - Marketing Department (with digital strategists)
  - Operations Department (with IT integration)
  - Education Department (with online learning specialists)

**Explanation**: The post-digital structure is flatter and more interconnected, with a dedicated digital leadership role and cross-functional teams to support initiatives like virtual tours and Tate Kids.

### 2. Business Process Redesign Exercise

**Objective**: Redesign a business process using digital tools.

**Activity**:
- **Selected Process**: Visitor ticketing at Tate Modern.
- **Traditional Workflow**:
  1. Visitors queue at the ticket counter.
  2. Staff manually process payments and issue paper tickets.
  3. Visitors present tickets for entry.
  - Issues: Long queues, high staff costs, and limited scalability during peak times.
- **Redesigned Process with Digital Tools**:
  1. Visitors purchase tickets via Tate’s website or mobile app, integrated with a CRM system for user data.
  2. A QR code is sent to the visitor’s phone or email.
  3. Visitors scan QR codes at automated entry points.
  4. Data analytics track ticket sales and visitor patterns to optimize pricing and scheduling.
- **Digital Tools Used**:
  - CRM system (e.g., Salesforce) for customer data management.
  - Mobile app for ticket purchases and QR code delivery.
  - Data analytics for demand forecasting.

**Flowchart**:

**Traditional Process**:
```
Visitor → Queue at Counter → Staff Process Payment → Issue Paper Ticket → Visitor Entry
```

**Redesigned Process**:
```
Visitor → Website/App Purchase → CRM Stores Data → QR Code Sent → Scan QR for Entry → Analytics Track Patterns
```

**Benefits**: Reduces staff workload, eliminates queues, and provides data for strategic decisions.

### 3. Impact Analysis on Workforce

**Objective**: Assess how digital transformation affects Tate’s workforce.

**Activity**:
- **Digital Technologies Introduced**: Websites, virtual reality, mobile apps, and data analytics.
- **Impact on Job Roles**:
  - **New Roles Created**: Digital curators, web developers, data analysts, and social media strategists to manage online platforms and analyze visitor data.
  - **Job Displacement**: Reduced need for ticket counter staff due to digital ticketing, though some roles shift to customer support for online platforms.
  - **New Skill Sets Required**:
    - Website management and content creation.
    - Data analytics for understanding visitor behavior.
    - Digital storytelling for engaging online audiences.
    - Familiarity with tools like virtual reality and CRM systems.
- **Strategies for Upskilling**:
  - Training programs on digital tools (e.g., CMS platforms, analytics software).
  - Workshops on social media and digital marketing.
  - Partnerships with tech firms for VR and app development training.
  - Hiring specialists to mentor existing staff.

**Report Summary**: Tate’s digital transformation created opportunities for innovation but required significant upskilling. While some traditional roles (e.g., ticketing staff) diminished, new roles in digital content and analytics emerged. Continuous training and hiring tech-savvy staff are critical to sustaining Tate’s digital strategy.

### 4. Digital Tools Evaluation

**Objective**: Compare digital tools used in Tate’s operations.

**Activity**:
