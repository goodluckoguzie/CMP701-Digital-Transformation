# Digital Transformation & Strategy: A Beginner’s Guide with Tate’s Case Study

## Digital Transformation and Strategy Explained

### 1. What’s Digital Transformation & Strategy?

Strategy is your game plan to win at something  whether it’s running a business, a nonprofit, or even planning a party. It’s the “how” behind reaching your goals.

Digital transformation is about using tech  think websites, apps, social media, or AI — to make your plan bigger, better, or totally new.

**Example**:  
- **Old-school bookstore**: Sells books in a physical shop.  
- **Digitally transformed bookstore**: Adds a website for online orders, sells eBooks, posts book reviews on social media, and hosts virtual author talks.

**Why it matters**:  
Digital tools can:  
- Save money (like automating tasks).  
- Reach more people (global customers, not just locals).  
- Make you stand out (unique experiences, like virtual reality tours).

### 2. How Digital Shakes Up Business Models

Digital tech can change how a company works in three ways:  
- **Complement**: Adds to what you already do (e.g., a store offering “click and collect”).  
- **Substitute**: Replaces old methods (e.g., streaming movies instead of renting DVDs).  
- **Disrupt**: Completely flips the game (e.g., Netflix killed video rental stores).

### 3. Two Kinds of Strategy

- **Deliberate Strategy**: A plan you make ahead of time, like a coach mapping out a season.  
  *Example*: Starbucks decides to launch a new coffee blend globally.  
- **Emergent Strategy**: Ideas that bubble up naturally from day-to-day work.  
  *Example*: A barista creates a viral TikTok drink, and Starbucks makes it official.

### 4. Porter’s Competitive Strategy

To win in business, you need to either:  
- **Be the cheapest** (Cost Leadership): Offer the lowest prices.  
- **Be unique** (Differentiation): Offer something special no one else has.

**Digital helps both**:  
- **Cost Leadership Examples**:  
  - Amazon uses robots in warehouses to cut costs.  
  - Budget airlines like Ryanair sell tickets online to avoid pricey call centers.  
- **Differentiation Examples**:  
  - Apple’s sleek designs and loyal fanbase.  
  - BMW’s tech-packed cars for a premium, sporty vibe.

### 5. The EasyJet Example

EasyJet used digital to:  
- Let customers book flights online, saving on staff.  
- Offer extras like seat selection or baggage add-ons.  
- Focus on business value (profit) over just “cool tech.”

### 6. Digital Transformation Framework (Hess et al., 2016)

To go digital, a company needs to:  
- **Change internal processes**: Train staff, streamline workflows.  
- **Create new value**: Sell digital products or services.  
- **Get leaders on board**: A CEO or digital officer pushing the vision.  
- **Find funding**: Use profits or investors to pay for it.

**Example**:  
A clothing brand might:  
- Train staff to manage an online store.  
- Launch a website for e-commerce.  
- Partner with Instagram influencers.  
- Hire a digital expert to lead the charge.  
- Reinvest store profits into digital projects.

### 7. Tate Modern’s Digital Journey

Tate, a UK art gallery, went big on digital, calling its online presence the “fifth gallery.”  

**What they did**:  
- Got every department involved in digital projects.  
- Trained staff on digital tools.  
- Had leaders champion the change.  
- Built cool stuff like websites, virtual tours, and even art-themed games.
