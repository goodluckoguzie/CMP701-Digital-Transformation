# Digital Transformation Strategy Workshop: Tesla & Airbnb

In this tutorial, you will learn how to develop a digital transformation strategy for two companies – Tesla and Airbnb – through a fun classroom activity. We’ll go step-by-step, using group discussions, mind mapping, and focused group discussions to explore ideas. 

## Part 1: Group Discussion and Brainstorming

Goal: Form a group, discuss the companies’ current digital maturity, and brainstorm ideas using sticky notes.

### Forming Your Group & Starting the Discussion

- Form a Small Team: Gather in groups of 3-5 classmates. Choose a team name if you like (e.g., "Team Tesla" or "Team Airbnb") to make it fun.
- Set Ground Rules: Agree to listen to each other and respect all ideas. For example, one person speaks at a time, and others listen without interrupting [tll.mit.edu](https://tll.mit.edu). It’s okay to disagree, but criticize ideas, not people [tll.mit.edu](https://tll.mit.edu).
- Pick Roles (Optional): You might assign a note-taker to write down ideas and a moderator to keep the discussion on track. Roles can help, but they aren’t required – the main point is everyone should participate actively.

### Discussing Tesla & Airbnb’s Digital Maturity

Start by clearly understanding what “digital maturity” means. Digital maturity is how advanced a company is in using digital technology in its business. A highly digitally mature company uses modern tech in most of its operations, while a low maturity company might still do many things the old-fashioned way (paper, in-person, etc.).

- **Tesla’s Current Digital Maturity**: Tesla is considered very digitally mature. For example, it's the only car company that can send software updates to its cars over the internet to improve performance and safety [papers.ssrn.com](https://papers.ssrn.com). Tesla also uses cutting-edge tech in its factories, like advanced robots to build cars and sensors/data from cars to keep improving [apiumhub.com](https://apiumhub.com). In short, Tesla heavily uses software, data, and automation in both its products (cars) and its operations (factories, sales).
- **Airbnb’s Current Digital Maturity**: Airbnb is also highly digital because it started as an online platform. It operates a global website/app that connects travelers with hosts, and it relies on data and algorithms to run smoothly. Airbnb uses a lot of advanced technology like artificial intelligence (AI) to improve customer service. For example, it uses AI to personalize recommendations for travelers (showing you places you might like based on your past bookings) [globenewswire.com](https://globenewswire.com). The company also relies on cloud computing (powerful online servers) to handle huge amounts of data and online transactions every day [globenewswire.com](https://globenewswire.com). In short, Airbnb’s business is built on digital tech, making it very mature digitally.

After discussing what Tesla and Airbnb are already doing with technology, your group should have a basic picture of where each company stands. Now it's time to brainstorm ideas for their digital transformation strategies!

### Brainstorming Ideas with Sticky Notes

Now for the fun part – brainstorming. You will think of new ideas, technologies, and strategies each company could use, and also consider challenges they might face. Use sticky notes (either physical Post-it notes or digital sticky notes in a tool like Miro) to jot down each idea. Here’s how to do it:

- Individual Brainstorm First: Give everyone a few minutes to quietly think and write down ideas on sticky notes. One idea per note! This way, even shy people get to contribute.
- Group Share: Stick all the notes on a board or wall. Take turns explaining your sticky note ideas to the group. Group similar ideas together on the board if they relate.
- No Bad Ideas: Remember, at this stage every idea is welcome. Crazy ideas can spark great discussions. Don’t criticize ideas yet – just collect as many as possible.

Example Sticky Notes for Tesla: (imagine each bullet is a sticky note idea from a student)

- Self-Driving Improvements – Use AI to make Tesla’s Autopilot even smarter and safer.
- VR Showroom – Create a virtual reality showroom so customers can “test drive” or explore a Tesla car online from home.
- Smart Factory – Add more IoT sensors in Tesla factories to monitor machines and predict maintenance (avoiding breakdowns).
- Mobile App Upgrade – Improve the Tesla smartphone app with new features (like remote diagnostics for your car).
- Blockchain Supply Chain – (Advanced idea) Use blockchain tech to track car parts globally for transparency and efficiency.
- Challenge – Regulations: Laws about self-driving cars might slow down Tesla’s plans (a regulatory challenge).
- Challenge – Cybersecurity: Tesla cars are computers on wheels, so they must prevent hacking – a big challenge to address.

Example Sticky Notes for Airbnb: (each bullet is a sticky note idea)

- AI Travel Planner – Use AI to create a smart travel planner that suggests complete trip itineraries (stay, activities, etc.) for Airbnb users.
- Virtual Tours – Offer 360° virtual tours or AR (augmented reality) previews of homes so guests can see a place before booking.
- Smart Home Integration – Provide smart locks or codes so guests can check in to Airbnb homes with their phones (no keys needed).
- Improved Matchmaking – Better matching algorithm to connect guests with the perfect host/home (based on preferences, past reviews).
- Green Initiative – Use digital tracking to show which listings are eco-friendly (like an online badge for solar power or energy saving devices).
- Challenge – City Regulations: Many cities have strict rules on short rentals. Airbnb needs to digitally track and follow local laws – a big challenge.
- Challenge – Trust & Safety: Ensuring trust (no scams, safe transactions) is hard – Airbnb must keep improving ID verification and fraud detection.

As you can see, brainstorming brings out technologies, strategies, and challenges. The sticky notes make it easy to visualize a lot of ideas at once. Once your group has a bunch of sticky notes for both Tesla and Airbnb, you’re ready to organize these ideas. That’s where the mind map comes in!

## Part 2: Mind Mapping Activity

Goal: Organize the brainstormed ideas into a structured mind map using Miro.com (a digital whiteboard tool). The mind map will have main topics like Current State, Goals, Technologies, and Challenges for each company, with details under each.

### Setting Up Miro for Mind Mapping

What is Miro? Miro is an online whiteboard where you can collaborate in real-time. You can create mind maps, stickies, diagrams, and more. We’ll use it to build our mind maps for Tesla and Airbnb. Steps to Start with Miro:

- Sign Up: Go to Miro.com and sign up for a free account. You can sign up with an email or use a Google account. It’s quick – you just need to verify your email address.
- Create a New Board: Once logged in, click the “+ New Board” button. Choose “Blank Board” for an empty canvas. Give it a name like “Week 10 Digital Strategy Mind Map”.
- Open the Mind Map Tool: In Miro’s toolbar on the left, find the Mind Map icon (it might be under “Apps” or you can add it). Click it, and then click on the board. Miro will place a central node (a box or circle) on the board with connectors for branches.
- Central Idea: Click the central node and type the name of the company and “Digital Strategy”. For example, “Tesla Digital Strategy”. This is the core of your mind map (the main topic).
- Add Branches: Now add the main branches around the central idea. Typically, for this activity, we use these branches:
  - Current State (where the company is now digitally)
  - Goals (what digital goals or vision do they have?)
  - Technologies (what tech or solutions to use)
  - Challenges (what obstacles or risks to overcome)
- You can add a branch in Miro by clicking the little plus (+) that appears when you select the central node, or by hitting Tab (which creates a new connected node).
- Add Subtopics: For each branch, add sub-nodes (subtopics) that detail your ideas. This is where you use the brainstorm sticky notes! For example, under Technologies for Tesla, you might add sub-nodes like “AI & Machine Learning”, “IoT Sensors”, “Mobile App”, etc. Each subtopic comes from an idea you discussed.
- Repeat for Airbnb: Create a separate mind map (on a new board, or the same board side by side) for “Airbnb Digital Strategy” with the same branches (Current State, Goals, Technologies, Challenges). This lets you organize Airbnb’s ideas similarly.

Tips:

- Keep each node’s text short – just a few words. (Mind maps are easier to read with brief phrases, not long sentences).
- You can style the mind map to make it clear: e.g. use one color for Tesla’s mind map and another color for Airbnb’s. In Miro, you can change a node’s color or drag them around for a neat layout.
- Feel free to add images or icons on the board if it helps (Miro lets you copy-paste images). For example, a Tesla logo in the center, or small icons for AI, etc., just to make it visually engaging.
- Make sure the structure is logical: someone who looks at your mind map should see the four main categories and the key points under each.

### Building the Mind Map Structure

Let’s break down what content goes under each part of the mind map. We’ll outline it here for both companies. You can copy these ideas into your mind map (just the text of the points) or use them as a reference to check your own ideas. Main branches to include:

- Current State: Where the company is now in terms of digital technology and processes.
- Goals: What the company aims to achieve with digital transformation (future vision).
- Technologies: The tools, technologies, or strategies they could use to transform.
- Challenges: The potential obstacles or issues they need to overcome.

Under each branch, we’ll add a few bullet points (these will become sub-nodes in your mind map).

#### Tesla – Mind Map Content Outline

- **Current State**:
  - Highly connected smart cars (each Tesla is online and receives updates).

  - User Safety & Trust – avoiding scams, false listings, and ensuring good host–guest behavior.
  - Competition – from hotels and other platforms (Booking.com, VRBO, etc.) pushing Airbnb to innovate.
  - Data Privacy – safeguarding user information and complying with privacy laws.
  - Handling crises (like a pandemic) – need digital resilience for sudden changes in travel behavior.

Now you have a solid example outline for each mind map. Your own mind maps can include these points or the ideas your group brainstormed (they might be similar). Using Miro, place each of those points as a subtopic under the appropriate branch. Arrange them visually around the center. You might end up with something that looks like the examples below.

### Example Mind Maps for Tesla and Airbnb

Below are illustrative mind map examples for Tesla and Airbnb. These show how you can arrange the Current State, Goals, Technologies, and Challenges with sub-points in a visual way. You do not have to match this exactly – it’s just to inspire you. The content is the same as the outline above, but here it’s shown as a mind map diagram.

Example mind map for Tesla’s digital transformation strategy. The central node is “Tesla Digital Strategy” with four main branches: Current State, Goals, Technologies, and Challenges. Under Current State, the example shows Tesla’s connected cars (with over-the-air updates) and automated factories. The Goals branch lists objectives like full self-driving cars, faster production, and better customer experience. The Technologies branch includes AI & Machine Learning, IoT sensors & data usage, and mobile apps & connectivity. The Challenges branch highlights issues such as regulations & safety, cybersecurity risks, high R&D costs, and finding tech talent. This visual layout helps to see all key aspects at a glance.

Example mind map for Airbnb’s digital transformation strategy. The central idea “Airbnb Digital Strategy” connects to four main topics: Current State, Goals, Technologies, and Challenges. In Current State, the map notes that Airbnb is a global online platform with data-driven recommendations. The Goals branch includes building trust & safety, offering personalized experiences, and global expansion. Under Technologies, it shows AI for recommendations, VR/AR tours, and cloud & data analytics as tools Airbnb can use. For Challenges, it lists rental regulations, user safety, competition (hotels), and data privacy. The mind map format makes it easy to see how Airbnb’s current digital state leads into its goals, what tech can help, and what hurdles exist.

How to use these examples: You can copy some of these points into your own Miro mind maps if you’re stuck, or just use them to check if your ideas cover similar ground. Remember, your group might have unique ideas too – feel free to include them. The key is that your mind map should clearly communicate where the company is now, where it wants to go, how it can get there (tech), and what might stand in the way. By the end of this step, you should have two completed mind maps (one for Tesla, one for Airbnb). Congrats! 🎉 You’ve taken a bunch of sticky note ideas and organized them into a strategic plan format. Now it’s time for Part 3, where you will present your mind maps and get feedback.

## Part 3: Focused Group Discussion (Presentation & Feedback)

Goal: Present your team’s mind maps to the class and engage in a focused discussion. You will practice presenting, giving feedback, and reflecting to improve the strategies.

### Presenting the Mind Map to the Class


- Team Preparation: Before class presentation, quickly decide who will talk about which part of the mind map. For example, one member can explain Current State, another covers Goals, etc. Practice once as a group so you know the order.
- Show the Mind Map: When it’s your turn, display your mind map to the class. If you’re in a physical classroom, you might use a projector or simply hold up a poster. In an online class, share your screen with the Miro board.
- Explain Clearly: Start from the center and work outwards. For example, “Our central topic is Tesla’s digital strategy. First, here’s Tesla’s current state: ... Next, these are our goals: ...” Speak clearly and not too fast. Use simple language – remember, even a 15-year-old (like you!) should understand it.
- Use Examples: When you mention a point, give a quick example or reasoning. E.g., “We listed AI under technologies because Tesla uses AI for self-driving features.” This helps others follow your thinking.
- Keep it Brief: Aim for about 3-5 minutes per company when presenting. You don’t have to mention every single sub-point if time is short – focus on the most important or interesting ones.

### Giving and Receiving Feedback

After each presentation, the class  will discuss it. This is the focused group discussion stage. Here’s how to handle feedback:

- Listening to Feedback: When you finish presenting, invite the class to ask questions or give suggestions. 
- Typical Feedback Questions: Your classmates or teacher might ask things like, “Why did you choose that goal?” or “Have you thought about another challenge?” Don’t worry – these aren’t criticisms, they’re to help you think deeper. Answer as best as you can. If you don’t know, it’s okay to say, “That’s a good point – we hadn’t thought of that.”
- Responding Calmly: If someone misunderstood your idea, calmly clarify it. For example, “I think I wasn’t clear – what I meant was that Airbnb could use VR for tours, not that it’s doing it yet.” Always thank people for their feedback.
- Giving Feedback to Others: When other teams present, you should also participate. Practice positive feedback first – mention what you liked or found clever about their mind map. Then you can ask a polite question or suggest an idea: “I wonder if Tesla might have another challenge with supply chains – what do you think?”. Be constructive and kind. Remember, the goal is to help each other improve, not to “win.”


### Reflecting and Improving the Strategy

Once all groups have presented and feedback has been shared, it’s time to reflect on what you learned:

- Group Debrief: Reassemble with your team and talk about the feedback you received. What were the main points others brought up? For example, maybe someone suggested a new technology your mind map missed, or pointed out a challenge you hadn’t considered.
- Identify Improvements: Decide as a group if you want to adjust your strategy based on the feedback. Perhaps add a sticky note or node for that new idea someone gave. This is an important part of learning – even in real companies, strategies improve after getting input from others [miro.com](https://miro.com) [miro.com](https://miro.com).
- Ask “What did we learn?”: Take a moment to have each member say one thing they learned from the activity. It could be about the company (e.g., “I learned Tesla updates its cars over the air!”), about teamwork (“brainstorming together gives more ideas than alone”), or about presentation (“I got better at speaking in front of the class”).
- Final Thoughts: Congratulate yourselves as a team. 🎉 Developing a digital transformation strategy is not easy, but you’ve done a great job. You now understand Tesla and Airbnb better, and you’ve practiced critical thinking and collaboration.

Outcome: By the end of Part 3, you will have a refined understanding of each company’s digital strategy and experience in group discussion and feedback. You saw how other teams approached the same task, which can give you new perspectives.

## Conclusion

In this activity, you went from brainstorming wild ideas on sticky notes to presenting a structured digital transformation strategy for Tesla and Airbnb. You practiced working in a group, organizing thoughts into a structured mind map, and then communicating and refining those ideas through discussion. This mirrors real-life processes where teams plan how to use technology to improve businesses. Remember:

- Digital transformation is about using technology to improve how a company works and serves customers.
- Tesla is already high-tech (smart cars, automated factories) but still pursues ambitious goals like self-driving and needs to tackle challenges like regulation and security.
- Airbnb thrives on digital platforms and data, aiming to make travel personalized and trust-rich, while navigating challenges like laws and safety.
- Teamwork and feedback are key. Great ideas often come from brainstorming together and iterating on feedback.
